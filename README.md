# Event Poster Maker

Event Poster Maker is web app created to facilitate rapid creation of DSC event posters while leveraging reuse of community contributed templates.

Below are steps required to run the app on your local development evironment.

## Prerequisites
You will need the following installed on your system.

1. [git](https://git-scm.com/)
2. [node](https://nodejs.org/en/)
3. [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli)

## Next
1. Open your terminal or command prompt and cd to the location you'll be cloning the project in
    ```
    cd ~/
    ```
2. Clone the project

    ```
    git clone https://github.com/DSCKenyattaUniversity/event-poster-maker
    ``` 

3. Change directory to the cloned project
    ```
    cd event-poster-maker
    ```
4. Install all the projects dependencies
    ```
    npm install
    ```

5. Run local development server
    ```
    npm run serve
    ```
    This starts a development server on port 4200, so you can launch your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`

    Alternatively, run `npm run build` to build the project. This should compile the project to a folder `dist/event-poster-maker`. Copy the contents of the folder to your local webserver's docroot.

## Contributing
Contributions are welcomed via Pull Requests especially contributions for poster templates. This README may not suffice in terms of documentation on how to create templates but you can check the sample templates provided under the `src/templates` directory.
